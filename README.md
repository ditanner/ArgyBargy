Party Game for Blinks Game System

Once loaded, blinks will glow blue and green. Arrange some in the center as a cluster (I'd suggest 4) - these will turn blue. Then attach a blink per player to the edges (only connected on one face) - these will glow green.

When ready to begin, double click a blink. The player ones will display a colour wheel, whilst the cluster will turn green. Players take their blink into their hand, and when everyone is ready, double click a cluster blink to begin.

The cluster blinks will display a selection of colours on each face. The players have to attach their blink to 2 cluster blinks, such that the touching faces match colour. If they do, they have won the round, and the cluster will turn purple. Double click to reset.

If no-one matches within 5 seconds, the cluster will randomise, and the game continues.
