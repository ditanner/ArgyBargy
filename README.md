Party Game for Blinks Game System

Once loaded blinks will glow yellow, showing they are in setup mode. Have each player take a single blink (which should change to green). Then remove other blinks until you are left with 4 in a cluster (for a 5+ player round) or 2 connected (for a 3-4 player round). The board blinks should also turn green when in a valid formation.

When ready to begin, click any tile on the board to display the board state. Then players race to click their blinks, look at the board, and find a space they can attach their blink, such that 2 board face colours match 2 on their blink. If they cannot see any spaces that match, they may click their blink again to get a new arrangement.

When they attach the blink, it should change the colour of the unattached faces to green, if a good match, or red if not. Then, any players that didn't get a good match (either because there were no spaces, or because they matched incorrectly) are eliminated. Play restarts by double clicking one of the connected blinks - they should reset to setup mode, and the remaining players start the next round.
